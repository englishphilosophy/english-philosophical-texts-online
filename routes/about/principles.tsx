          The purpose of this project is to make a broad canon of English
          philosophical texts easily and freely available for students and
          scholars to read, search, and computationally analyse and compare. To
          this end, and to keep things within reasonable bounds, we aim to
          provide just one <em>critical text</em>{" "}
          for each work, but a critical text without any textual apparatus or
          commentary. In other words, we aim to identify the most authoritative
          copytext – typically the last edition the author saw through the press
          – and then to silently ‘correct’ it according to our best judgement
          (e.g. by incorporating variants from another edition or manuscript
          that seem preferable, or implementing changes noted in any published
          ERRATA sheets).
        </p>
        <p>
          A silently edited critical text, without any accompanying critical
          apparatus, is of course of limited use for serious textual
          scholarship. But the editions provided on this site are not intended
          for that purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though our <em>aim</em>{" "}
          is to provide (silently edited) critical texts, we expect to be
          striving towards this goal for some time, and we will provide
          imperfect editions along the way. In practice, we will be constrained
          by the quality of the publicly available digital editions that we have
          to start with, and by our own limited time and resources. We would be
          enormously grateful if, while using the texts on this site, you could
          keep an eye out for potential errors and inform us of any that you
          notice.
        </p>
        <h2>Formatting</h2>
        <p>
          Our copytexts use italics and small-caps for emphasis, and sometimes
          capitalise (or render in small-caps) the first word of every
          paragraph. We replicate this formatting here. As a rule, we do not
          extend such formatting to the surrounding punctuation (in the original
          texts it is not always clear whether the surrounding punctuation is
          thus formatted or not). Many texts also start each section with a
          large dropped capital (spanning two lines), or even an ornamented
          capital. These are rendered here simply as normal capital letters.
        </p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          All notes are rendered here as endnotes at the end of each section (in
          an online publication with no page breaks, the idea of a footnote does
          not apply). For ease of reference, we have replaced note anchors with
          numbers. In some original texts, there is a distinction between
          footnotes and endnotes; in such cases, there is invariably a footnote
          pointing the reader to the relevant endnote. We preserve this
          distinction by reproducing the footnote text pointing to the endnote,
          but then display the text of the endnote immediately following.
        </p>
        <h2>Margin Comments</h2>
        <p>
          Some texts include small comments printed in the margin, typically
          indicating the topic currently being addressed in the main text. These
          comments are rendered here floating to the right of the paragraph,
          rather than in the actual margin.
        </p>
        <h2>Apostrophes</h2>
        <p>
          The use of the apostrophe changed during the eighteenth century,
          eventually settling on the present conventions. In the seventeenth and
          early eighteenth century, however, its usage was somewhat
          inconsistent. We preserve these inconsistencies here, leaving
          apostrophes as they are in the originals.
